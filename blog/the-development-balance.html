            <p>My daily job as a developer other than programming is about finding the right
balance between different things:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Buzzword driven development vs rock solid boring things.</li>
  <li>New technologies vs something already adopted inside the company.</li>
  <li>State of the art implementation. Something that can work in an hour.</li>
</ol>

<p>And many more. I am sure you will have your own list. What I noticed during
these years working for different companies, with different teams and in
different states is that there are a lot of kind of developers, we are full of
companies and projects to develop.</p>

<p>You should really look for the right place for you, but you need to know what to
look for.</p>

<p>What I am trying to say that people, colleagues, companies can help you to find
your balance be proactive on this research. Speak with your manager or with your
colleagues about what you are happy to do or not you will find interesting
answers if you are working with people with your same mindset. You will probably
come up selling and buying tasks and issues from member of the teams because
they like more what you are doing and vice versa.</p>

<p>Sometime you will even have the sensibility to grab a bored task just to have it
done and leave your colleagues free to do something more fun.</p>

<p>This is the kind of work that I like. I am almost sure about that now. A place
where shit needs to be done and you have an active word on how, it doesn’t need
to be a decision, sometime I don’t know what’s better for the company or for the
project, but can’t be always a black box that come from the ground and needs to
be done. I am not an check list implementer and dealing with my colleagues and
other people is an active and very good part of my day.</p>

<p>When it’s time to have fun because things are going well and even when you are
the unique different voice out form a meeting. Find the right place where you
feel free to say your opinion, be wise and mature enough to know that your
opinion can be good or bad can’t be always the one to follow.</p>

<p>The right balance between all of these things, across teams, companies gives to
me the feel to be in the right place.</p>
